## Requirements

- Python 3.10.16 (or lower, **mandatory for TTS to be installed**)
- Internet connection for model download (first run only) and voice download (if needed)

## Installation

**_NOTE: Skip this section if you are using `uv` (recommended)_**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, copy the .env.example file to .env:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

And adjust it accordingly. Anyway, you can override the configuration at runtime.

## Usage

**_NOTE: If you are using `uv`, dependencies will be resolved in a .venv file at runtime_**

**IMPORTANT: The included voice sample is noisy and short, so the result might be low quality. Use a better one for production. Sorry.**

### Using uv

```bash
uv run src/main.py
```

### Normal python

```bash
python src/main.py
```
